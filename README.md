## Key Features

### Android Application
- **Share Mode (Host)**: Creates a high-performance Wi-Fi Direct hotspot that bypasses carrier tethering limits by routing traffic through a local SOCKS5 proxy. Persistent background operation even when screen is locked or app is swiped away.
- **Multi-device sharing**: Serves multiple Android and Windows clients concurrently without allowing one busy device to starve later connections.
- **Connect Mode (Client)**: Connects to a host phone and tunnels all system traffic through a VPN using tun2socks for robust, gaming-optimized packet handling.

### Laptop Client (Python)
- **Global VPN (TUN) mode**: Captures 100% of Windows traffic (required for games like Roblox)
- **Automatic setup**: Downloads wintun and tun2socks binaries on first run
- **Health monitoring**: Automatic proxy health checks with 2-fail restart logic
- **Console Bridge (ICS)**: Share the Windows VPN with consoles and other devices over a selected Ethernet adapter or Windows Mobile Hotspot
- **Lightweight GUI**: Clean CustomTkinter interface

### Debug Tools (laptop_proxy/tools/)
- **diagnostic.py**: Standalone TCP/UDP/DNS probe tool through the SOCKS5 proxy
- **traffic_monitor.py**: Real-time connection logging via ADB logcat + TUN adapter stats + CSV output
- **tests/**: Unit tests for proxy bridge, tun manager health, and routing

## How to Use

### 1. Setup the Host (Phone with internet)
1. Open the Android app and go to the **Share (Host)** tab.
2. Choose Wi-Fi Band (5GHz recommended for gaming).
3. Click **START SERVICE**.
4. Grant battery optimization exemption when prompted (keeps service alive).
5. Note the SSID, Password, Proxy IP, and Port from the info card.

### 2. Connect another Phone (Client)

2. Open the app on the second phone and go to **Connect (Client)** tab.
3. Enter the Host IP and Port from the host phone.
4. Click **START VPN**.

### 3. Connect a Laptop
1. Connect the laptop to the host phone's Wi-Fi network.

1. Wait for the Windows VPN to show **Connected**.
2. Under **Share with consoles & devices**, choose a connected Ethernet adapter or **Wi-Fi hotspot** and click **Start Sharing Network**.
3. Connect the console with automatic IP/DNS and no proxy setting. See [the console guide](NON_APP_DEVICES.md) for troubleshooting and NAT limitations.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Bypass method** | SOCKS5 proxy over Wi-Fi Direct hides tethering traffic from carriers |
| **MTU tuning** | Optimized for gaming (MTU 1350) to reduce packet fragmentation |
| **Persistence** | Android Foreground Service + WakeLock + AlarmManager restart logic |
| **Connection stability** | Immediately scaling worker pool, 10-minute TCP idle cleanup, 5-minute UDP association cleanup, and 64KB pipe buffers |
| **Multi-client limits** | Up to 256 simultaneous proxy connections globally and 128 per client IP, preventing a single device from consuming the host |

## Building

### Android App
Open in Android Studio and build the APK.
